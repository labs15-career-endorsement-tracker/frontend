## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/hKTAKrBD/endrsd)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Career-Endorsement-Tracker-38de5156701f4cebb29de81a4b6db1ad)

"ENDRSD" is a capstone project that was built as a centralized location for Lambda School students to access track-specific career endorsement requirements, as well as provide students with a fun and engaging way to track their career endorsement progress.

### Key Features

- Uses an authenticated dashboard to show students a list of their career endorsement requirements, which are tailored to each individual student's progress
- Allows students to access static resources, such as Airtable links and lecture videos
- Allows students to track their progress towards getting endorsed
- Provides gamification mechanisms to incentivize students to actively participate in the endorsement process
- Allows students to continue working on an incomplete requirement, where they previously left off
- Allows students to set SMART (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely) goals

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React.js, React Hooks, & Redux

- It comes with a good supply of documentation, tutorials, and training resources because of the well established community around it.
- The use of components allows for modularity for faster, more efficient development.
- Components can contain their own logic and controls.
- Testing with React.js is very straight-forward and comes with great documentation.

#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/labs15-career-endorsement-tracker/backend) built using:

#### Node.js, Express.js, KNEX, PostgreSQL, Bcrypt.js

# APIs

## 2️⃣ Authentication API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Water's like me. It's laaazy ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A little happy sunlight shining through there. Let all these little things happen. Don't fight them. Learn to use them. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 2️⃣ Payment API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

This is the way you take out your flustrations. Get away from those little Christmas tree things we used to make in school. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things? Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

You can do anything your heart can imagine. In life you need colors. This is where you take out all your hostilities and frustrations. It's better than kicking the puppy dog around and all that so. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

When you do it your way you can go anywhere you choose. Let your heart take you to wherever you want to be. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. A tree needs to be your friend if you're going to paint him. That's a son of a gun of a cloud. Even the worst thing we can do here is good.

## 3️⃣ Misc API here

🚫Replace text below with a description of the API

Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. Maybe there's a happy little waterfall happening over here. You can spend all day playing with mountains. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. It's cold, but it's beautiful.

# 3️⃣ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

🚫These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_API - this is your public Stripe API key, generated in the Stripe dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_backendURL - optional for your local development server
    *  REACT_APP_clientid - this is the Stripe_connect clientID, generated in Stripe_connect settings
    *  REACT_APP_stripe_plan - this is the ID for a second Stripe subscription plan, generated under Stripe products

# 5️⃣ Content Licenses

🚫For all content - images, icons, etc, use this table to document permission of use. Remove the two placeholders and add you content to this table

| Image Filename | Source / Creator | License                                                                      |

# 4️⃣ Testing

🚫Document what you used for testing and why

# 4️⃣ Installation Instructions

🚫explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

🚫replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
