## Key Features

- Students can create their own user accounts and passwords
- Users are able to login & logout to protect their career endorsement information
- With proper credentials, students are able to view a list of their track-specific career endorsement requirements via a user dashboard
- Students are able to track their overall endorsement progress, as well as stay up-to-date on the progress being made towards individual requirements for endorsement
- Students can access static resources pertaining to specific endorsement requirements, such as Airtable forms and lecture videos

## Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React.js, React Hooks, & Redux

- It comes with a good supply of documentation, tutorials, and training resources because of the well established community around it.
- The use of components allows for modularity, leading to faster and more efficient development.
- Components can house their own logic and controls.
- Testing with React.js is very straight-forward and comes with great documentation.

#### Front end deployed to [Netlify](https://endrsd.com)

#### [Back end](https://github.com/labs15-career-endorsement-tracker/backend) built using:

#### PostgreSQL

- PostgreSQL is a type of relational database that is open source and freely available for anyone to use.
- SQL databases have a reputation for being more reliable because they have been tried and tested longer than their NoSQL counterparts.
- The source code for PostgreSQL was developed by a large community that has created numerous online resources for support.
- The strongly-typed schemas with a SQL database leave very little room for errors.

#### Node.js

- Node.js offers easy scalability because it can handle a large number of simultaneous connections with high throughput.
- Using node.js allows developers who are familiar with JavaScript, to develop both the client-side and server-side applications using a single programming language.
- Node.js takes less time to learn because it utilizes an already popular client-side scripting language---JavaScript.
- Support for node.js is readily available because of the large and active community behind it.
- Node.js is able to take advantage of caching things within the application memory for faster load times.

#### Express.js

- Express.js makes web application development with node.js fast and easy.
- It is very easy to configure and customize express.js.
- Express.js allows you to create a REST API server.
- Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.

#### Knex.js

- A SQL query builder that integrates well with a PostgreSQL database.
- Allows for 'migrations', which makes it easier to manage tables within the PostgreSQL database.
- It can create sequential files with timestamps and even manage table alterations.
- Allows for the creation of 'seeds', which can be used to consistently populate the database.

# Authentication

#### JSON Web Tokens

- A self-contained token which has authentication information, expiration information, and other user properties.
- JWTs don't have sessions to manage (stateless).
- No database table is required, which means fewer database queries.
- Can be used across multiple services.

#### Bcrypt.js

- Protects against 'rainbow table attacks'.
- Resistant to brute-force search attacks.

# API Server URLs

- [Local Server URL](https://localhost:5000/api/v1)
- [Staging Server URL](https://endrsd-api-staging.herokuapp.com/api/v1)
- [Production Server URL](https://endrsd-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1)

# API Endpoints

- GET `/api/v1/users/:userId`
- GET `/api/v1/tracks`
- GET `/api/v1/requirements`
- GET `api/v1/requirements/:requirementsId/steps`
- POST `/api/v1/users`
- POST `/api/v1/login`
- PUT `/api/v1/requirements/:requirementsId/steps`

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-here>
            -This can be any unique string of characters.

    *  REACT_APP_STAGE=staging
            -This must be included in the .env to utilize the staging database.

    *  REACT_APP_STAGE=production
            -This must be included in the .env to utilize the production database.

If no `REACT_APP_STAGE` environment variable is added to the `.env` file, the default local database on port 5000 will be utilized.

# Installation Instructions

After cloning this repo on to your local machine, use the package manager [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) to install all of the required dependencies for the ENDRSD app.

```bash
yarn install
```

When all of the proper dependencies have been installed, create a `.env` file that stores the `JWT_SECRET` and the `REACT_APP_STAGE` environment variables as shown above. This particular `.env` setup will allow you to immediately connect to the staging database instead of having to create a local database.

```bash
JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-here>
REACT_APP_STAGE=staging
```

Lastly, run `yarn start` to create a build on your local machine that can be viewed at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
yarn start
```

## Other Scripts

    * format - formats code using 'Prettier' extension
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory
    * eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
